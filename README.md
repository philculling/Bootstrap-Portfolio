# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Personal portfolio using Bootstrap (week 3 challenge)

## Description
I wanted to create a portfolio which will be added to later.
I wanted to use some Bootstrap styling in my new portfolio which I hoped would make it look better than the previous one.
I wanted to continue with my learning of basic HTML and CSS, particularly CSS.
I wanted to reinforce good habits of commenting out, and frequent commits.
I wanted to practise further the process of pushing work to github.
I wanted to deploy my finished product and check it had no errors.
I wanted to practise writing an appropriate README.md.
I wanted to reinforce some other relatively new techniques, such as use of hover on links, and box-shadow.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage

When the website opens, there are links in the header to the content below, for ease of user.
There are links from the Work section to examples of completed work, although the second example was not created by me, the task was to refactor the code without altering the site itself.

Site is published at https://philculling.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio
